# Installation & Configuration

Installing and setting up Aureus ERP is quick and straightforward. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Run the Installation Command**  
   Simply execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   php artisan erp:install
   ```

2. **What Happens During Installation**:

   - **Migrations & Seeders**:
     - All migrations and seeders from the core or base Laravel project are executed to set up the database schema and populate initial data.
   - **Roles & Permissions**:
     - The `Filament Shield` package automatically generates roles and permissions for the application.
   - **Database Seeders**:
     - Additional seeders are generated and executed to ensure the database is fully populated with the required default configurations.

3. **Admin Account Setup**

   - After the installation process, the command prompts you to provide **Admin Login Credentials** (email and password).
   - These credentials are used to log in to the admin panel.

4. **Installation Complete**  
   Once the above steps are finished, the installation process is complete, and you can start using Aureus ERP.

Thatâ€™s it! With just one command, your Aureus ERP environment is ready to use.
