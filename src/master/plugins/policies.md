# **Overview**

Policies in Aureus ERP are used to enforce authorization rules for different models. They help restrict or allow user actions based on permissions and roles.

## **Key Features of Policies**

- Define authorization logic for each model.
- Grant or deny access based on user roles and permissions.
- Integrate with Laravel’s `Gate` and `authorize` methods.
- Automatically associate policies with models using conventions.
- Work seamlessly with Spatie’s role and permission package.

Policies help in defining access control for models, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
